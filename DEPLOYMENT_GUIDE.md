# Deployment Guide for BAHM Flutter Web App

## GitHub Pages Deployment

Your Flutter web app is set up to deploy automatically to GitHub Pages when you push to the main branch.

### Steps to Deploy:

1. **Build the web app locally first** (optional but recommended for testing):
   ```bash
   flutter build web --release --base-href /bahm/
   ```

2. **Commit and push your changes** to the main branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Check GitHub Actions**:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on the "Actions" tab
   - You should see the deployment workflow running
   - Once completed, your app will be available at: `https://arnold254-25.github.io/bahm/`

### Getting Feedback on Appearance

Once deployed, you can share your live link with others for feedback:

1. **Share the URL**: `https://arnold254-25.github.io/bahm/`

2. **Request specific feedback** on:
   - UI/UX design
   - Color scheme and typography
   - Navigation and user flow
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Overall visual appeal

3. **Platforms to share for feedback**:
   - Reddit: r/FlutterDev, r/web_design
   - Discord: Flutter Community
   - Twitter/X: Use hashtags #FlutterWeb #UIUX
   - LinkedIn: Professional networks
   - Designer communities like Dribbble or Behance

### Backend Considerations

Since you have a Node.js backend, note that:
- GitHub Pages only serves static files (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Your backend APIs will need to be deployed separately (consider Vercel, Heroku, or Railway for backend)
- Update your API endpoints in the Flutter app to point to your deployed backend

### Testing Locally Before Deployment

```bash
# Build and serve locally
flutter build web
cd build/web
python -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs for build errors
2. Ensure all dependencies are properly listed in pubspec.yaml
3. Verify that your Flutter web build works locally first
