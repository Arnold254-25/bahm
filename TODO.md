# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix - Progress Tracking

## Problem Identified
GitHub Pages error: "No such file or directory @ dir_chdir0 - /github/workspace/docs"
- GitHub Pages was configured to use `/docs` directory but it doesn't exist
- Missing GitHub Actions workflow for proper deployment

## Steps Completed ✅
- [x] Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow for Flutter web deployment
- [x] Updated `GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md` documentation with correct instructions

## Next Steps
- [ ] Commit and push the changes to GitHub repository
- [ ] Go to GitHub repository Settings → Pages
- [ ] Configure GitHub Pages source to use "GitHub Actions"
- [ ] Select the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
- [ ] Wait for the workflow to run automatically on push to master
- [ ] Verify deployment at https://arnold254-25.github.io/bahm/

## Files Created/Modified
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- `GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md` - Updated documentation

## Workflow Details
The new workflow:
- Runs on push to master branch
- Sets up Flutter environment
- Builds Flutter web app in release mode
- Deploys built web files to GitHub Pages using GitHub's Pages deployment action

## Troubleshooting
If deployment still fails:
1. Check GitHub Actions tab for detailed error logs
2. Ensure all required files are committed to master branch
3. Verify Flutter web build works locally: `flutter build web`
