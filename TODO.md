# Fix MissingPluginException for local_auth Plugin

## Completed Fixes âœ…

1. **Android Permissions Added** - Added required biometric permissions to AndroidManifest.xml:
   - `android.permission.USE_FINGERPRINT`
   - `android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC`
   - `android.permission.INTERNET`
   - `android.permission.CAMERA`

2. **Build Configuration Fixed** - Cleaned up build.gradle.kts file by removing misplaced permission declarations

3. **iOS Permissions Verified** - Confirmed iOS Info.plist already has `NSFaceIDUsageDescription`

## Next Steps to Complete the Fix

1. **Clean and Rebuild** - Run the following commands to ensure proper plugin registration:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Platform-Specific Steps**:
   - **Android**: The permissions are now properly configured
   - **iOS**: Already has Face ID permission configured

3. **Test Biometric Features**:
   - Test on a physical device (biometric features don't work on emulators/simulators)
   - Ensure device has biometric authentication set up (fingerprint/Face ID)
   - Test the security setup flow in the app

## Troubleshooting Tips

If the issue persists after these fixes:

1. **Check Flutter Doctor**: Run `flutter doctor -v` to verify all dependencies
2. **Plugin Version**: Ensure local_auth version is compatible (currently using ^2.3.0)
3. **Device Setup**: Verify biometric authentication is enabled on the test device
4. **Platform Channels**: The MissingPluginException should now be resolved with proper permissions
